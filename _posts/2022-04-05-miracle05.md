# 4/5 디지털 에셋을 만드는 법

## 디지털에셋

- 돈을 쓰면서 배워야함.

## 디지털 세상에서 나의 자산을 거래

### 처음 번 돈의 의미. 1,000배로 돌아온다.

- 디지털 에셋은 린하게 출시하고 유저의 피드백으로 커가는 것이다.

## 무료와 유료의 경험차이

- 내가 돈 내고 배운 것이 유료 경험.

## 영어공부

And second, I have a highly developed sense of testing smell

Flour, eggs, sugar, vanila bean, oh small twist of lemon.

Oh you can smell all that?

You have a gift

#7

This is emilie. My brother.

He is easiliy impressed.

So you can smell ingredients. So what!

This is my dad. He is never impressed.

He also happens to be the leader of our clan.

So what’s wrong with having a highly developed senses?

#8

Don’t eat that!

What’s going on here?

Turns out that funny smell was rat poison.

Suddenly dad didn’t think my talent was useless.

I was feeling pretty good about my gift.

#9

Until dad gave me a job.

That’s right. Poison checker.

Close to godliness. Which means clean.

You know cleanliness close to godliness.

Never mind. Move on
